<h1>CMPG-323-Project-2</h1>
<p>Project 2 for CMPG 323. In this project we will be designing an API.</p>
<p>
    For my project my API will be used to interface with<br>
    The Marius Ella Holiday Apartment block Database<br>
    This will later enable the front end to have access to<br>
    modify and maintain the correct data of each user.
</p>
<h1>I will be incorporating CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) as the operations available</h1>
<h1>This project will reach it's end in 2022-09-08</h1>
<h1>API Properties</h1>
<p>
    The API will be created using C# .Net Core Web API. <br>
    For documentation the API will be incorporating swagger to create <br>
    and deploy the documentation. <br>
</p>
<h1>Database Properties</h1>
<p>
    The database will be running on Microsoft SQL Server. Allowing me to use the <br>
    Microsoft Entity framework. <br>
    //Will link ERD of database later.
</p>
<h1>There will be 3 Branches:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Main: The active branch which holds the most stable version</li>
    <li>Hotfix: This branch is there for small and quick bug patches</li>
    <li>Development: This branch is there for feature development and testing</li>
</ul>
