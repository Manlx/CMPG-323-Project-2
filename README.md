<h1>CMPG-323-Project-2</h1>
<p>Project 2 for CMPG 323. In this project we will be designing an API.</p>
<p>
    The API will allow the future development of an website/web app which uses this API <br>
    to Get Post and Remove data from the Connected Office Database
</p>
<h1>I will be incorporating CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) as the operations available</h1>
<h1>This project will reach it's end in 2022-09-08</h1>
<h1>API Properties</h1>
<p>
    The API will be created using C# .Net Core Web API. <br>
    For documentation the API will be incorporating swagger to create <br>
    and deploy the documentation. <br>
</p>

<h1>There will be 6 Branches:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Main: The active branch which holds the most stable version</li>
    <li>Hotfix: This branch is there for small and quick bug patches</li>
    <li>Development: This branch is there for feature development and testing. This branch has been depricated</li>
    <li>Basic API: This branch would have been the base to test and configure Swagger</li>
    <li>Swagger Dev: The original branch to test and configure Swagger</li>
    <li>Swagger Inject: Based on the basic API branch is where Swagger was added after having a successfull scaffold build</li>
</ul>
